# Reflection

Working on this project has been an intense and challenging journey. Each step required careful consideration and problem-solving, often pushing me out of my comfort zone. I built this website incrementally, asking ChatGPT for guidance on individual elements, which helped me understand concepts piece by piece.

JavaScript, in particular, still feels like a realm of black magic to me — there’s a lot I don’t fully grasp yet, but this project has been a valuable introduction to its power and potential.

I intentionally avoided replicating the example site provided on assignment page, as I didn’t find it appealing. I know I could have done so using the browser's inspect tools, but I wanted to create a site that I could proudly showcase in my future portfolio. While it still requires a fair amount of polishing, I am satisfied with the progress and direction of this project.

Overall, this experience has taught me patience, problem-solving, and the importance of breaking a complex task into smaller, manageable parts. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made, and I’m eager to continue learning and refining my skills.
