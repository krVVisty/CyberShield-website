        <h2>Best Practices for Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. By following these best
          practices, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to
          cyber threats. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate all risks, but
          to manage them effectively and stay informed about the evolving
          landscape of cybersecurity.

      <section id="Tip1">
        <h2>1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h2>
        <p>
          Passwords are the first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords can
          be easily guessed or cracked. A strong password – ideally 20+
          characters mixing letters, numbers, and symbols – makes it
          exponentially harder for hackers to break into your accounts. For the
          general public, this means your emails, banking, and social media
          remain safe from strangers trying to steal your identity or money.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="Tip2">
        <h2>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
        <p>
          2FA is like having two locks on your door instead of one. Even if a
          burglar (or hacker) gets a key (your password), they still need the
          second key to get in. First factor: your password (something you know)
          Second factor: a code sent to your phone, an app, or a physical
          security key (something you have) So, when you log in, you type your
          password and enter a short code that changes every few seconds. This
          makes it much harder for hackers to access your accounts, because
          they’d need both your password and your phone/app. Why it matters for
          everyone: Even if a hacker steals your password in a data breach, they
          cannot log in without the second factor. It’s simple, effective, and
          gives everyday users extra protection for email, banking, social
          media, and more.

      <section id="Tip3">
        <h2>3. Keep Software Up to Date</h2>
        <p>
          Software updates aren’t just about new features—they fix security
          holes that hackers can exploit. Running old software is like leaving
          your doors unlocked. By updating regularly, your devices stay
          protected against the latest threats.

      <section id="Tip4">
        <h2>4. Use a VPN on Public Wi-Fi</h2>
        <p>
          Public Wi-Fi in cafes, airports, or hotels is convenient but not
          secure. Hackers can spy on your internet activity. A VPN creates a
          private, encrypted tunnel for your data, keeping passwords, banking,
          and personal info safe—even on public networks.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="Tip5">
        <h2>5. Backup Your Data Regularly</h2>
        <p>
          Ransomware, hardware failure, or accidental deletion can wipe out your
          files instantly. Backing up your important documents and photos to the
          cloud or an external drive ensures you never permanently lose your
          data. It’s like having a spare set of keys for your digital life.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="Tip6">
        <h2>6. Limit Data Sharing and Permissions</h2>
        <p>
          Many apps ask for access to your contacts, camera, or location
          unnecessarily. Granting too much access can expose personal
          information if the app is hacked. Only give permissions that are truly
          necessary, protecting your privacy without impacting usability.
        </p>

      <section id="Tip7">
        <h2>7. Secure Your Devices Physically</h2>
        <p>
          If your phone, laptop, or tablet is stolen, someone could access your
          accounts and sensitive data. Using passwords, PINs, or biometrics
          (fingerprint or face recognition) keeps your information safe, even if
          someone grabs your device.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="Tip8">
        <h2>8. Educate Yourself About Emerging Threats</h2>
        <p>
          Cyber threats are constantly evolving, from AI-powered scams to clever
          phishing tricks. Staying informed through news and updates is like
          having a personal alert system for your digital life. Awareness can
          prevent mistakes before they happen.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="Tip9">
        <h2>9. Practice Safe Browsing Habits</h2>
        <p>
          Stick to trusted websites and look for “HTTPS” in the address bar when
          entering sensitive info. Avoid pirated downloads or unknown links.
          Safe browsing is like walking on well-lit streets rather than dark
          alleys—it greatly reduces your chances of being “robbed” online.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="Tip10">
        <h2>10. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts</h2>
        <p>
          Hackers often trick people into giving away sensitive info through
          fake emails, messages, or websites. Recognizing suspicious links or
          attachments protects your personal data and finances. For the general
          public, it’s like checking an envelope before handing over cash—it
          prevents being scammed.
