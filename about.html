        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          CyberShield’s mission is to empower people with the knowledge and
          tools needed to navigate the digital world safely and confidently. In
          today’s age, access to information is easier than ever before, yet the
          tools that shape our digital lives have also become more complex and
          potentially dangerous. Emerging technologies, such as artificial
          intelligence, can be used both to protect and to exploit — creating
          new risks in areas like identity theft, misinformation, and automated
          cyberattacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          CyberShield seeks to bridge this gap by making cybersecurity knowledge
          clear, practical, and accessible to all, not just to experts. Our aim
          is to help individuals understand the threats they face, cultivate
          safer digital habits, and recognise how modern tools can be used
          responsibly. In a world where technology evolves faster than
          regulation and awareness, education is the most effective shield we
          have.
